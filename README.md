# Balls and boxes ðŸŽ®

I've made a few little games here and there in Unity, but this is the first one I followed through on and completed.
There's still a lot I want to add, and I will when I have more time. This project was fun - it started out as something quick but I ended up deciding to add more and more to it, which was fun but difficult considering being in class and not having much time to work on it. I learned a couple new things and got some practice with a few things in Unity. [Give the game a try](https://jswashburn.itch.io/bnb) on Itch.IO! I know there're bugs but that's what makes this stuff fun right?
### A few things I learned:
- Creating UI elements
- Using Unity's UI system
- Got some practice using interfaces (the color theme changer)
- Forced me to brush up on some vector math
- Unity's LineRenderer component is a pain in the butt
- Planning is actually important
- HackNPlan is greate for project management
- Much much more...
